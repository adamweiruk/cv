## Dissertation

### Automated Microscopy Cell Counting using Neural Networks, 2022

*In this project, a novel artefact is produced as part of an automatic counting solution for filamentous cyanobacteria cells. This artefactâ€™s central component is a neural network model, trained on a novel dataset of images depicting A. flos-aquae. This artefact, and the experimental process by which it is developed, demonstrates that neural network models for detection and localisation can be successfully applied to the task of cell counting. It also shows how this approach might be improved upon in future work, chiefly by creating a richer and more reliable dataset, and optimising the project methodology.*
